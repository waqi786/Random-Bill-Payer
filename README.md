# Random-Bill-Payer
This repository contains a Python script that randomly selects a person from a list of names to pay the bill. Users input comma-separated names, and the script uses the random module to pick a name. It's a fun tool for deciding who pays in a group setting. Uploaded on 07/14/2024.
